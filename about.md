I'm a programmer/techie guy. I like building web applications using all standard technologies and huge passion for writing code (preferably open source and on my MacBook Pro).

I also know a good variety of programming languages too..Ruby, Rails, Angularjs, NodeJS, CI(continous integration), Chef, Puppet etc.. Ruby is my all time favourite and for framwwork offcourse its Rails. I also start working on Devops. 

On this blog, I would like to publish my experience with software development practices as well as more specific topics around my favourite languages (Ruby) and tools of choice. Iâ€™ve putting my hands on with quite a few different languages as well as frameworks in the past.

I design and develop web based products using Rails,Sinatra, AngularJs and other variety of technologies. I love clean design and building applications that are both functional and beautiful.  To see examples of my work, please visit my [portfolio](https://github.com/kishore-mohan?tab=repositories).

I live in Bangalore, India, When I am not programming, I enjoy being outdoors, riding bikes, treaking, net surfing, building things and hanging out with my friends and family.
