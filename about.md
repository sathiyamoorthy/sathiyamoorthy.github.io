I'm a Java & Ruby programmer/techie guy and keep moving my career in HealthCare Domain. I would like to analyze and building a web application and providing services using all standard technologies and huge passion for writing code.

I also know a good variety of programming languages too.. Java, Ruby, Rails, HL7 etc.. and pretty much knowlege on design & play arroud backend services & databases like prostgres, mysql, cassandra, mongodb, oracle.

Bundle (karaf, osgi) & providing 'n' number services in a secure and easy way is my all time favourite.

I will always try to apply the "Operation Research" (OR) terminology and algorithms in my coding if it actually needs, because it holds a handy and optimized soultion for most of real time problems, yep ofcourse i did my master degree in OR at NITT. 

On this blog, I would like to publish my experience with code snipet in software development practices as well as more intersting topics around my favourite works & tools.I love clean design and building applications & providing services that are both functional and beautiful. To see examples of my work, please visit my [portfolio](https://github.com/sathiyamoorthy?tab=repositories).

I live in Bangalore, India, love to play keyboard, cricket and hanging out with my friends and family.
