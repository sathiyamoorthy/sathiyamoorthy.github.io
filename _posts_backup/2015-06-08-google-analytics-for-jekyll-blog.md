### Google Analytics integrating with Blog(Wordpress, Blogspot, Jekyll.. etc)

Every Blog provided way to integrate with google analytics. Just need to configure Tracking ID using third party tool or direct UI level configuration.

> Jekyll Blog Detail Google Analytics Integration.

**For Jekyll Blog User**. Integrating google analytics into Jekyll is completely depends on the theme because some of the theme which can automatically insert the Google Analytics code. Iâ€™ll try to explain how to add the Google Analytics in most Jekyll themes and not Jekyll Bootstrap.

It may quite tricky for who don't understand jekyll layout theming.But, you can identify which file by looking under the:

> _includes

This folder basically holds all the layouting in Jekyll. you can check is there any file called _default, header.html, footer.html. And pase the code above the </head>. At the end, it would be exactly like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-63861353-2', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>
{% endhighlight %}
